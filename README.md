    <h2><strong>Pls Donate To Me proxy server</strong></h2>

The server used to handle requests between ROBLOX and the third-party API being provided. Now there's a problem when it comes to ROBLOZ http requests, the thing is that it doesn't let you requests ROBLOX stuff itself, it can't. 

For this, the solution is to create a proxy server that handles such requests, this can be easily done with `express` and `fetch`, which let us get data and then send back to the client requesting. 

This is not open-source at all, the code can be reused, forked or anything. But the link to the proxy server won't be leaked, neither other information related to it!
